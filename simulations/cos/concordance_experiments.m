% Script explores what different concordance measures do for bivariate
% generated distributions with different dependencies.

%%
% Generate samples from different known copula's for different theta's, and
% compare spearman's rho, and kendall's tau (would be nice to add MIC to
% this)  for continuous marginal distributions
