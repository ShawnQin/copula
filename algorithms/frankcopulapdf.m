function [ y ] = frankcopulapdf( u, alpha, varargin )
%GUMBELCOPULAPDF Computes the PDF of the Frank Copula for N>=2
% Inputs:
%  u - an M x N matrix of all the points over which to compute the Frank
%      copula PDF, M is the number of points in a unit-hypercube of
%      dimension N
%  alpha - the dependency parameter of the Frank copula.  
%      Please NOTE!! There is a difference in terminology between Mathworks
%      and R, in R (and seemingly in academic literature), theta is used as
%      the dependency parameter, and alpha = 1/theta.  Mathworks seems to
%      like to define the dependency parameter as alpha.  In this code, we
%      stick to the (unfortunate) Mathworks convention of using alpha as
%      the dependency parameter!!, 
%      Consequently we assign 1_div_alpha = 1/alpha
% Optional Inputs:
%  varargin{1} - if 0, then compute pdf directly, 
%                else, compute log of pdf at specified value
%
% Outputs:
%  y - the value of the Clayton copula density at the specified value in
%      the unit hypercube
