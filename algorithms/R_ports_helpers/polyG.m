function [ y ] = polyG( lx, one_div_alpha, d, varargin )
%POLYG - Compute the coefficients a_{dk}(theta) involved in the generator derivatives
%and the copula density of a Gumbel copula
% Inputs:
%  lx = log(x); where x: evaluation point (vector);
%        e.g., for copGumbel@dacopula, lx = alpha*log(rowSums(iPsi(u)))
%        where u = (u_1,..,u_d) is the evaluation point of the density of Joe's copula)
%  one_div_alpha - alpha parameter (1/theta) in (0,1];
%      Please NOTE!! There is a difference in terminology between Mathworks
%      and R, in R (and seemingly in academic literature), theta is used as
%      the dependency parameter, and alpha = 1/theta.  Mathworks seems to
%      like to define the dependency parameter as alpha.  In this code, we
%      stick to the (unfortunate) Mathworks convention of using alpha as
%      the dependency parameter!  Therefore, in here we have one_div_alpha,
%      meaning that the input to this function should be 1/theta, where
%      theta is the dependency parameter of the Gumbel copula 
%  d number of summands, >= 1
% Outputs:
%  y - the output value
