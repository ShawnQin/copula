function [ y, edges ] = discretizeRv( x, N, varargin )
%DISCRETIZERV Discretizes a random variable using a specified method
% Inputs:
%  x - a vector of samples from a continuous random variable to be
%  discretized
%  N - the number of discrete intervals
%
% Optional Inputs:
%  varargin{1} - if 0, then compute pdf directly, 
%                else, compute log of pdf at specified value
% Outputs:
%  y - the discretized binned data
%  empInfo - the empirical information (i.e. pdf, cdf, domain)
